This is a framework for writing bots that play Hanabi.
http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi

It is very much a work in progress.

Typing "make" will build all of the bots that the Makefile knows about.

./run_BlindBot
  (blindly plays a random card each time: avg score 1.26-)
./run_SimpleBot
  (hints about playable cards: avg score 17.89-)
./run_ValueBot
  (also warns about valuable cards: avg score 18.20-)
