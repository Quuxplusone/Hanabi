# Hanabi
Bot for use with Quuxplusone Hanabi framework

Note that this bot uses the rule that allows for 'null' clues.
See http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/869065/can-you-tell-someone-they-have-0-cards-value-or-co
which states the designer allows null clues.
This is implemented in HanabiServer by commenting out the lines that assert on null clues.

AwwBot is based on the scheme noted in
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1384616/aww-strategy-those-who-dont-fear-convention

This version of AwwBot implement a minimal forward finesse. It is limited to cluing LH2 to get LH1 to
play a card that he may not know is playable (or even been clued yet!)
