This is a framework for writing bots that play Hanabi.

It is very much a work in progress.

Try one of these command lines:

clang++ *.cc -g -DBOTNAME=BlindBot
  (blindly plays a random card each time: avg score 1.25)
clang++ *.cc -g -DBOTNAME=SimpleBot
  (hints about playable cards: avg score 18.5)
